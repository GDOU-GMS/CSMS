	WHAT IS AGILEUI

	The AUI Framework is a HTML/CSS/JS framework that helps you quickly build modern, beautiful and accessible user interfaces for interactive web applications. It is powered by jQuery and includes a lot of UI interactions, effects, widgets, elements, components and themes. These make AUI a very powerful companion when it comes to solving all kinds of use cases. Read through the documentation to get an idea of how many widgets and elements are available.

	WHO IS IT FOR?

	AUI is for both designers and developers. Designers can use the three layer theming system to create new styles. Because, in general, developers do not have an eye for design, the AUI framework helps them by removing the design-related issues and lets them concentrate on the app programming part.
